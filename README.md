# Flow Timer

This timer web app is designed to help you efficiently manage your meeting schedules and other time-based activities. Unlike standard interval timers, it offers unparalleled flexibility, allowing you to create single timers, sequences of timers, or even recursive timers tailored to your needs. The app also includes a library of predefined timers for popular use cases, such as Pomodoro (health), Liberating Structures (meetings), and Tabata (sports). As a Progressive Web App (PWA), it can be installed directly on your device, ensuring a seamless and offline-capable experience.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
